# **Solar Flare Detection Model**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on detecting solar flares by analyzing solar images using a deep learning model. A solar flare is a sudden burst of radiation from the sun, releasing significant magnetic energy. The model classifies images into two categories: **flare** or **non-flare**.

## **Objective**
The goal is to determine whether a solar flare has occurred based on an image of the sun.

## **Preprocessing**
The following preprocessing techniques were applied to the images:
- **Resizing**
- **Normalization**
- **Data Augmentation**
- **Color Maps for Luminosity**

## **Dataset**

## **Model**
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to train the model for flare detection.
